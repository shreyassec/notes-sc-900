**Part 2: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft Identity and access management solutions**

1. Describe common identity attacks
- Password-based attacks
- Phishing
- Spear phishing

2. Define Identity as the primary security perimeter
- Four pillars of identity: Administration, Authentication, Authorization, Auditing

3. Modern authentication
- Client ---"auth"--> Identity provider---"token"---> Client
Client ---"token"---> Server
- Server has trust relationship with the Identity provider
- SSO between multiple identity providers is called federation

4. Describe the concept of Federated Services
E.g.:
The website uses the authentication services of IdP-A.
The user authenticates with IdP-B.
IdP-A has a trust relationship configured with IdP-B.
When the user’s credentials are passed to the website, the website trusts the user and allows access.

5. Describe the concept of directory services and active directory
- AD DS does not natively support modern authentication methods used by mobile devices, SaaS, cloud services etc.
- Azure Active Directory is the next evolution of identity and access management solutions. It provides organizations with an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution for all their apps across cloud and on-premises. 
- AAD is the cloud based Identity Provider.
- When sharing your apps and resources with external users, Azure AD is the default identity provider for sharing.

6. Describe the available Azure AD editions
- Azure Active Directory Free
- Office 365 Apps
- Azure Active Directory Premium P1
- Azure Active Directory Premium P2

7. Describe Azure AD identity types
- users: Employees, guests, B2B users etc. Can assign groups and roles to users in AAD
- service principals: A service principal is a security identity used by applications or services to access specific Azure resources. You can think of it as an identity for an application.
- managed identities: used to manage the credentials for authenticating a cloud application with an Azure service.
	  - System-assigned
	  - User-assigned
- devices
	  - Azure AD registered devices: personal account signin
	  - Azure AD joined: org sign in
	  - Hybrid Azure AD joined devices: ADDS signin
	  - IT admins can use tools like Microsoft Intune, a mobile device management (MDM) solution, to manage devices.

8. Describe the types of external identities
- Azure AD External Identities is a set of capabilities that enable organizations to allow access to external users, such as customers or partners.
- Available only with P1 and P2 AAD editions
- B2B collaboration: allows external users to access your resources with their credentials
	  - External users marked as guest users in the employee directory
- B2C access management: allows external users to sign in with their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on to your applications.
	  - external users are managed in the Azure AD B2C directory, separately from the organization's employee and partner directory
	
9. Describe the concept of hybrid identities
- With the hybrid model, users accessing both on-premises and cloud apps are hybrid users managed in the on-premises Active Directory.
- For updates to on-prem ADDS, all updates to user accounts, groups, and contacts are synchronized to your Azure AD. The synchronization is managed with Azure AD Connect.
- When using the hybrid model, authentication can either be done by Azure AD, which is known as managed authentication, or Azure AD redirects the client requesting authentication to another identity provider, which is known as federated authentication.
- 3 AuthN methods:
	  - Password hash synchronization: Users have the same username and password that they use on-premises
	  - Pass-through authentication (PTA): A software agent runs on on-prem servers and these servers validate users directly with the on-prem ADDS, preventing cloud authN
	  - Federated authentication: Azure AD hands off the authentication process to a separate trusted authentication system, such as on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), to validate the user’s password.

10. Describe the different authentication methods of Azure AD
- Azure Active Directory multifactor authentication: Something you know, Something you have, Something you are
- Security defaults: set of basic identity security mechanisms recommended by Microsoft
  	- enforces AAD MFA registration for all users

- Privileged access lifecycle
- Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM), provides extra controls tailored to securing access rights
- PIM is a feature of Azure AD Premium P2

18. Describe what is entitlement management and access reviews
- Entitlement management is an identity governance feature that enables organizations to manage identity and access lifecycle at scale.
- Entitlement Management is required because: 
  	-Users may not know what access they should have, and even if they do, they might have difficulty locating the right individuals to approve it.
  	- When users find and receive access to a resource, they may hold on to access longer than is required for business purposes.
  	- Managing access for external users.
- EM delegates creation of access packages to non-administrators and includes rules like which users can request access,who will approve and when it expires. New users can simple request for these access packages. Similar for external users.	
- Entitlement management is a feature of Azure AD Premium P2.

19. Azure AD access reviews

- Sign-in risk
  	- Atypical travel. Sign-in from an atypical location based on the user's recent activity.
  	- Anonymous IP address. Sign-in from an anonymous IP address; for example, Tor browser, anonymized VPNs).
- User risk
	  - Unfamiliar sign-in properties. Sign-in with properties you've not seen recently for a given user.
  	- Sign-in from a malware-linked IP address.
  	- Leaked credentials. Indicates that the user's valid credentials have been leaked.
  	- Password spray. Indicates that multiple usernames are being attacked using common passwords in a unified, brute-force manner.
  	- Azure AD threat intelligence. Microsoft's internal and external threat intelligence sources have identified a known attack pattern.
- Available reports: risky users, risky sign-ins, and risk detections
- Identity Protection is a feature of Azure AD Premium P2.
